         SOCK_STREAM is generally used for the former, and SOCK_DGRAM for the latter.
         
         The third argument is the protocol. It should be 0 except in unusual circumstances, and then allows the operating system to chose TCP or UDP, based on the socket type. TCP is chosen for stream sockets, and UDP for diagram sockets
